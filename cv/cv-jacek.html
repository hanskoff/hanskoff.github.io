            <p>Financial data aggregation system - helped client with making improvements in throughput (using Akka Streams) and correctness (comprehensive tests via ScalaCheck).</p>
            <p>A platform for analyzing energy usage - we rebuilt an old, ineffective system which took hours to process daily data batches. The result was a big data platform, capable of processing huge amounts of data daily and later analysing them using both statistical and machine learning methods. We used Scala with Akka (Actors, Streams and Http), Cassandra, Spark for the data processing and Ansible to build the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Knip ( knip.ch)  – I developed an insurance recommendation service (a REST API and a web frontend) which analyzes the user’s insurance portfolio and suggests various adjustments based on other insurers’ offers, the user’s peer group and an arbitrary set of rules. The technology stack was Play Framework with Scala, Slick and H2 plus an AngularJS frontend, tested with Jasmine and Protractor.
 </p>
 <p>Zerigo ( zerigo.com)  – I made huge refactorings and developed new features in a legacy virtualization- related backend system, which integrates several VMWare APIs (vCloud, vSphere, vShield) into one REST API used by a consumer portal. The main areas of improvements, apart from reducing code duplication and bugfixes, were: writing tests (which were not there before), introducing detailed and informative error handling which greatly improved and speeded up troubleshooting of various issues, creating an easy-to-use fluent API for synchronous/asynchronous execution of PowerShell scripts on guest virtual machines, creating a developer and end-user-friendly framework for asynchronous task execution.
The system is built with Java 8 using Spring Boot and AspectJ, tested with Spock, Spring MockMVC and rest-assured.

            <p>I rewrote a part of a sophisticated registration module using Grails with Twitter Bootstrap and AngularJS.
I was a designer and developer in an internal project (currently suspended) whose aim was to build a simple training database. I used JSF2 with PrimeFaces components and Pretty Faces for SEO- friendly URLs, CDI (Weld), Seam 3, EJB 3.1, JAX RS, using Arquillian for integration testing. The application is running on JBoss AS 7.1 and a MySQL 5 database. The building, testing and continuous integration processes are automated with Maven and TeamCity.</p>
<p>For 2 years I have been a developer and technical leader in a project for Polish Telecom (tp.pl). The aim of the project is to develop a central configuration repository (a so-called “product catalog”) for some of the company’s critical systems. The technology stack included: JSF 1.2 with RichFaces, Spring 3, JPA2 with Hibernate, Tomcat 6, PostgreSQL 8.3. We were also using Maven for building and testing automation as well as Hudson/Jenkins and TeamCity for continuous integration.</p>

<p>My previous position was a designer and developer in a project for  Scarus, Germany (scarus.de) ; the tasks included designing and developing new features for the company’s IntelliCleaner  – a tool for automated address data cleaning and merging; I developed both a desktop application in Swing and a web application with JSF 1.2, Spring 2, JPA and Hibernate, running on Tomcat 6, PostgreSQL 8.2.</p>
 
<p>I have been a consultant for Reaktor, Norway (reaktor.no ), helping to design and develop an algorithm for optimal playback of commercials in cinemas  with maximum revenue while adhering to given constraints. This was a short-t erm position which ended up with a proof-of-concept of a distributed genetic algorithm using JPPF (Java Parallel Processing Framework) and JGAP (Java Genetic Algorithm Package).
I have been working on a project for  Polish Agency of Enterprise Development ( parp.gov.pl) . I have designed and implemented a large module for the company’s custom CMS  – the module dealt with handling customer contracts, financial documents, services and a knowledge database. The technologies included: EJB3, JPA, Hibernate with Envers, Struts 1.1, JBoss 4, Tomcat 5, PostgreSQL 8.2.</p>
 
<p>I have been one of the developers of a large CRM system for a leading Polish direct insurance company (Link4, link4.pl) . The system is used for selling and maintaining vehicle, household and travel policies, it covers such insurance business areas as: contact management, calculating policy premiums, policy covers handling, registering claims and damages, manipulating accounting data associated with policies and claims, data exchange with external providers (e.g. credit card payments, vehicle pricing), document imaging. I used technologies such as: IDIT Framework, JadeSQL, Weblogic 9.2, EJB 2.1, Struts 1.1, JSP, Oracle 10g.</p>

            <p>As a part of my Master’s thesis I designed and developed a part of a remote multimedia system allowing remote browsing of multimedia content stored on a home PC with a mobile phone, including photo browsing and audio/video streaming. My responsibilities included creating the front end for the mobile remote user (issues: user-friendly navigation, photo resizing and conversion discovering client phone's capabilities) as well as designing the streaming solution based on existing open- source software (i.e. Darwin Streaming Server). The front end was developed as a Servlet/JSP application running on Apache Tomcat with XHTML/WML at the presentation layer.</p>
